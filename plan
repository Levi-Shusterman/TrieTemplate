Plan:

1) Allow the template class functions to be called from a .cpp file.
2) Write test cases for insert and retrieve
3) Write the trie (insert & retrieve)
	You're going to do this sequentially:
		Node Class
		Insert
		Retrieve

4) Try to separate interface and implementation. This is somewhat tough with templates.
